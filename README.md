# PointNet-RDF-MDTraj
Predict RDF distribution from a single molecular configuration dumped from MD trajectory

## Data sets 
The data used to train the model and available at: https://zenodo.org/record/7776442. 

*Due to the large amount of data, after decompressing the folder, the bz2 files inside also need to be decompressed to npz files.*

## train the model on different liquid systems  
e.g. train on Ar system: `python Ar_rdfxyzPT_finer_NPZ.py`
